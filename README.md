# Baseball Simulation Project (Portfolio Version)

This project combines **Python**, **R**, **C++**, and **Stan** to simulate baseball game outcomes and allocate bet sizes under uncertainty.  

It demonstrates:
- Bayesian hierarchical modeling (Stan / R)
- Simulation of in-game events (C++)
- Data wrangling and orchestration (Python & R)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is a **portfolio/demo repository**.  
All raw data and execution pipelines have been removed. The code is provided for demonstration purposes only and is **not runnable as-is**.  

See `docs/methodology.pdf` for details on the approach and design.
